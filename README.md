# Wen Merlin
Wen Merlin is a small serverless application for scraping the abracadabra [Merlin contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2c3a9c577068479b1e5119f6b7da98d25ba48f4).  
The lambda generates a helpful UI for displaying recent Merlin buybacks and current fees.  
You can visit the live application at [wenmerl.in](https://wenmerl.in)

Special thanks to [ap0calyp](https://gist.github.com/ap0calyp) for the fee endpoints!
